## MPI Service

This folder contains the code for the Master Patient Index / PAS Microservice, which provides the Ripple interface to Hospital systems (initially simulated using the QEWD database holding demo demographic data)

Start up this container as a foreground process using the *rtweed/qewd-server* Docker Container:

       sudo docker run -it --rm -p 8082:8080 -v ~/ripple/mpi-service:/opt/qewd/mapped rtweed/qewd-server

or, to run it as a daemon process:

       sudo docker run -d --rm -p 8082:8080 -v ~/ripple/mpi-service:/opt/qewd/mapped rtweed/qewd-server


Note 1: the -p parameter defines the port mapping, using the convention:

      -p {external port}:{internal port}

The *qewd-server* container always uses port 8080 internally.  

The external port is for you to define.  You MUST ensure that it is accessible from:

- the PHR Conductor service and matches with its ms-hosts.json configuration;
- the IDCR Conductor service and matches with its ms-hosts.json configuration;


Note 2: if you're using a Raspberry Pi (RPi), use the RPi-specific Container: *rtweed/qewd-server-rpi*
